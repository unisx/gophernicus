Compiling and installing Gophernicus Server
===========================================

Gophernicus requires a C compiler but no extra libraries aside
from standard LIBC ones. Care has been taken to use only
standard POSIX syscalls so that it should work pretty much on
any *nix system. 

To compile and install run:

$ gzip -cd gophernicus-server-*.tar.gz | tar xvf -
$ cd gophernicus-server-*
$ make
$ sudo make install

The add something like this to your /etc/inetd.conf and restart
inetd (or kill -HUP or whatever):

gopher  stream  tcp  nowait  nobody  /usr/sbin/in.gophernicus  in.gophernicus -h <hostname>

The -h <hostname> parameter is mandatory for a properly working
Gophernicus Server. Other parameters can also be added, see the
full list by running "/usr/sbin/in.gophernicus -?"

By default Gophernicus serves gopher documents from /var/gopher
although that can be changed by using the -r <root> parameter.
To enable virtual hosting create hostname directories under
the gopher root and make sure you have at least the primary
hostname (the one set with -h <hostname>) directory available
(mkdir /var/gopher/$HOSTNAME).


Shared memory issues
====================

Gophernicus uses SYSV shared memory for session tracking and
statistics. It creates the shared memory block using mode 600
and a predefined key which means that a shared memory block
created with one user cannot be used by another user. Simply
said, running in.gophernicus as yourself will allocate that
memory, and then running the binary through inetd as another
user (nobody) will be denied access to that memory.

If that happens you can simply delete the memory block and
let Gophernicus recreate it - no harm done.

$ su -
# ipcs -m | grep beeb
# ipcs -M <key from the above command>


Porting to different platforms
==============================

If you need to port Gophernicus to a new platform, please take
a look at gophernicus.h which has a bunch of HAVE_* #defines.
Fiddling with those usually makes it possible to compile a working
server. And if you succeed in compiling Gophernicus to a new
platform please send the patches to kim@holviala.com so I can 
include them into the next release.

Tested and semi-supported platforms include:
