Things I should work on:

	* properly document gophertags
	* gophertags text should be run through strniconv()
	* fix debian postinst/prerm/postrm (questionless upgrades)


Things I might work on:

	* Support for config files
	* Password-protected resources
	* Allow/Deny per IP/host
	* Automated feature testing script (perl?)
	* SSL/TLS
	* Standalone pre-forked (threaded?) version
