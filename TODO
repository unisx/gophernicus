Things I should work on:

	* README needs work...
	* Automated feature testing script (perl?)
	* Script handlers: .php -> /usr/bin/php5-cgi
	* Configurable filetypes
	* main() should be shorter


Things I might work on:

	* Logparser (real-time?)
	* BUG: symlinks to directories aren't sorted with other
	  directories but with files
