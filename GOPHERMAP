!Sample gophermap for the Gohphernicus Server

##
## This is a sample gophermap.
##
#
Creating a file called "gophermap" into a directory disables the
normal resource listing and replaces it with the contents of the map
file. You can also have inline gophermaps - files with a ".gophermap"
extension are parsed as gophermaps and displayed in between normal
resources in alphabetical order.

In a gophermap any line that doesn't contain a <TAB> character is 
automatically converted to an type "i" gopher resource which are
displayed as plain text in the client. Lines which contain tabs are
intepreted as gopher resource lines which the client will render as
links.

The format of a resource line is simple:
Xname<TAB>selector<TAB>host<TAB>port

Where:
   X          is the gopher filetype
   name       is an explanation of the resource
   selector   is the path to resource
   host:port  are the hostname and port number to go to

Type and selector are mandatory, if you don't specify host or port
the host:port of the current server are used instead. Also make sure
to use ONLY ONE TAB between the fields.

Valid filetypes include:
   0   text file
   1   directory
   3   error message
   5   archive file (zip, tar etc)
   7   search query
   9   binary file
   g   GIF image
   h   HTML file
   i   info text
   I   other image file
   p   PDF file
   s   sound file

Additional type characters supported by Gophernicus:
   #   comment - rest of the line is ignored
   !   title resource for gopher++ clients
   -   hide the file referred in name (no wildcards)
   ~   include a list of users who have ~/public_gopher
   %   include a list of available virtual hosts
   *   stop processing gophermap, include resource listing
   .   stop processing gophermap
