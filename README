=== INSTALLING ===

Gophernicus requires a "C" compiler but no extra libraries aside from
standard LIBC ones. It has been tested on Linux with GCC but it
should work with other Unix-like systems and compilers as well.

To compile and install run:

$ make
$ sudo make install

The add something like this to your /etc/inetd.conf and restart
inetd (or kill -HUP or whatever):

gopher  stream  tcp  nowait  nobody  /usr/sbin/tcpd  <EXEC>

Replace <EXEC> with the path to your binary and the necessary
arguments (-h is mandatory for a working Gophernicus install):

/usr/sbin/in.gophernicus -h full.host.name -r /var/gopher
