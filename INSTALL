Gophernicus requires a C compiler but no extra libraries aside from
standard LIBC ones. Care has been taken to use only standard POSIX
syscalls so that it should work pretty much on any *nix system. 

To compile and install run:

$ gzip -cd gophernicus-server-*.tar.gz | tar xvf -
$ cd gophernicus-server-*
$ make
$ sudo make install

The add something like this to your /etc/inetd.conf and restart
inetd (or kill -HUP or whatever):

gopher  stream  tcp  nowait  nobody  /usr/sbin/in.gophernicus  in.gophernicus -h <hostname>

The -h <hostname> parameter is mandatory for a properly working
Gophernicus Server. Other parameters can also be added, see the
full list by running "/usr/sbin/in.gophernicus -?"

By default Gophernicus servers gopher documents from /var/gopher
although that can be changed by using the -r <root> parameter.
To enable virtual hosting create hostname directories under
the gopher root and make sure you have at least the primary
hostname (the one set with -h <hostname>) directory available
(mkdir /var/gopher/$HOSTNAME).

If you need to port Gophernicus to a new platform, please take
a look at gophernicus.h which has a bunch of HAVE_* #defines.
Fiddling with those usually makes it possible to compile a working
server. And if you succeed in compiling Gophernicus to a new
platform please send the patches to kim@holviala.com so I can 
include them into the next release.
